# Eight-Puzzle-Solver

### Introduction

This is my first Visual Studio project from scratch

This is the classic eight puzzle game created as a Windows Presentation Foundation application in Visual Studio

The game gives the option to randomize the board and give the user a change to solve it

Additionally, I have implemented multiple algorithms to solve the current state of the board. The user can randomize the board (using the 'Randomize' button, or setting it themselves) and have the AI solve the board. The AI will instruct the user to take the steps to solve the board.

### Algorithms used

#### Depth-First Search

#### Breadth-First Search

#### Greedy Best-First Search

##### Heuristics Used
- Number of misplaced tiles
- Manhattan distance

#### A* Search
