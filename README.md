# Eight-Puzzle-Solver
First Visual Studio project from scratch

This is a simple eight puzzle game created as a Windows Presentation Foundation application in Visual Studio

The game gives the option to randomize the board and give the user a change to solve it

Additionally, I implement an eight puzzle solver using DFS, BFS, Greedy Best-First Search, A* Search (using multiple heuristics)

The aim of this project is to learn creating applications in Windows C# while exploring the field of Artificial Intelligence.
